# One World Quest– Python Coding Lab – Learn by Doing
This is a custom-built, interactive coding website inspired by Blockly, designed specifically for young learners enrolled in the One World Quest Camp. The platform introduces children to the world of programming through a fun and visual drag-and-drop interface, helping them build foundational skills in logic, problem-solving, and creativity.

In addition to Blockly-style visual coding, the platform also features a Python Practice Lab – a beginner-friendly coding space where kids can experiment with Python syntax and run small programs in a safe, guided environment.

Features
✅ Drag & Drop Coding Interface – Blockly-style workspace for kids to create programs using blocks.

🧠 Maze Runner, 🐢 CodeSketch (Turtle Graphics), and 🎬 Match & Move (Pattern Animator) games for learning through play.

👨‍💻 My Lab – A sandbox environment where kids can build and test their own logic and ideas.

🐍 Python Practice Zone – A basic editor where students can write and test simple Python code.

🧒 Designed specifically for ages 8–14 in the One World Quest coding camp.

How to Use:
Choose a coding activity: Maze, Turtle Drawing, or Pattern Matching.
Drag and snap blocks together to build your program.
Use the Run Program button to see the results instantly.
Switch to My Lab to create your own custom programs.
Practice real Python code in the Python Practice Zone (optional for advanced learners).
